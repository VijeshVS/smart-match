# 🧠 Hiring at the Speed of Thought

Built as part of a **12-hour intense hackathon** at **BMS College of Engineering**, organized by **Rotech**.

We were challenged to build an **AI-powered applicant categorization platform**—and we delivered a system that transforms the hiring experience for both **candidates** and **HRs/interviewers**.

## 🚀 What We Built

An intelligent, two-sided platform that enables **faster hiring decisions** for HRs and provides **growth insights** for candidates.

### 🔍 One-liner:
**Hiring at the speed of thought.**

## 👩‍💼 For HRs

- **Filterfy**: Skip the manual filters. Just **describe your hiring needs in plain language**, and our AI will surface the most suitable candidates.

### 🎁 Rewards & Subscription Model

- Every time you leave a review for a candidate, you **earn coins**.
- Coins can be **redeemed for platform membership** or **premium features**.
- Access to **Level 3 candidates** (highly experienced profiles) is exclusive to **subscribed HRs**.
  - You can **subscribe directly**, or
  - **Earn coins** by reviewing candidates and **redeem for access**.
